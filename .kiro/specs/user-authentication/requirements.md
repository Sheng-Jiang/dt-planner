# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a comprehensive user authentication system to the Digital Transformation Planner application. The system will provide secure user registration, login, logout, and password reset functionality to protect user data and enable personalized experiences. This authentication layer will serve as the foundation for user-specific strategy canvases and saved planning sessions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account with email and password, so that I can save and access my digital transformation strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL display a form with email, password, and confirm password fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a new user account and redirect to the login page
3. WHEN a user enters an email that already exists THEN the system SHALL display an error message "Email already registered"
4. WHEN a user enters passwords that don't match THEN the system SHALL display an error message "Passwords do not match"
5. WHEN a user enters an invalid email format THEN the system SHALL display an error message "Please enter a valid email address"
6. WHEN a user enters a password shorter than 8 characters THEN the system SHALL display an error message "Password must be at least 8 characters long"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log into my account with my email and password, so that I can access my saved strategies and personalized content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display a form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and redirect to the main application
3. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message "Invalid email or password"
4. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL maintain the user session across page refreshes
5. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page when accessing protected routes
6. WHEN a user enters empty email or password fields THEN the system SHALL display validation errors for required fields

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to securely log out of my account, so that my session is terminated and my data remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logged-in user clicks the logout button THEN the system SHALL terminate the user session
2. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all authentication tokens and session data
4. WHEN a logged-out user tries to access protected routes THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message "Successfully logged out"

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who forgot their password, I want to reset my password using my email address, so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Forgot Password" on the login page THEN the system SHALL display a password reset form
2. WHEN a user enters their email address for password reset THEN the system SHALL send a password reset email if the email exists
3. WHEN a user clicks the reset link in the email THEN the system SHALL display a new password form with a valid reset token
4. WHEN a user submits a new password with a valid reset token THEN the system SHALL update the password and redirect to login
5. WHEN a user tries to use an expired or invalid reset token THEN the system SHALL display an error message "Reset link is invalid or expired"
6. WHEN a user enters an email that doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL display a generic message "If the email exists, a reset link has been sent"
7. WHEN a user successfully resets their password THEN the system SHALL invalidate all existing sessions for that user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication state to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to log in every time I visit the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL store a secure authentication token
2. WHEN a user returns to the application with a valid token THEN the system SHALL automatically authenticate the user
3. WHEN a user's token expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication
4. WHEN a user closes and reopens their browser THEN the system SHALL maintain their logged-in state if the token is still valid
5. WHEN a user logs in from a different device THEN the system SHALL allow multiple concurrent sessions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user passwords to be securely stored and transmitted, so that user data is protected from security breaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates or updates a password THEN the system SHALL hash the password using a secure algorithm
2. WHEN authentication data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS encryption
3. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL compare hashed passwords without storing plaintext passwords
4. WHEN generating authentication tokens THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random generation
5. WHEN storing user sessions THEN the system SHALL use secure, httpOnly cookies where applicable
